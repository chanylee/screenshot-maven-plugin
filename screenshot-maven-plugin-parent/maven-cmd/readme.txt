The files in this folder are intended for the owner of the open source project to perform releases on a
Windows machine.  

When running the prepare goal inside Eclipse I get the following error:

"Maven executable not found at: C:\workspaces\screenshot-maven-plugin\screenshot-maven-plugin-parent\EMBEDDED\bin\mvn.bat"

This forces me to run Maven outside Eclipse from the command line. These files helps me to avoid typing 
the Maven release commands every time a release should be performed.
